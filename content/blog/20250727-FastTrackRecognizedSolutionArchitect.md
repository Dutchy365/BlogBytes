A very special blog to me personal this time! 

Something pretty cool: I became a [FastTrack Recognized Solution Architect (FTRSA) for Power Apps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/fasttrack/recognized-solution-architects) accepted by Microsoft. ðŸŽ‰
Itâ€™s one of those titles that sounds great on LinkedIn, but behind it is actually a lot of work, learning, and collaboration. In this blog, Iâ€™ll explain what the program is about, how I got there.

## What is the FastTrack Recognized Solution Architect program?

Letâ€™s start with the basics. The FTRSA program is Microsoftâ€™s way of recognizing solution architects who work with the Power Platform. Itâ€™s not something you apply for like a regular certification, nomination is based on real-world work: large, complex implementations, adherence to best practices, and technical and functional knowledge.

The process includes a formal review by Microsoftâ€™s engineering team, submission of architecture artifacts, and even an interview. Itâ€™s thorough â€” and thatâ€™s what makes the recognition feel real.

## My journey to becoming an FTRSA

This wasnâ€™t something I set out to do from day one. It started with simply loving what I do â€” working with customers, solving real business problems, and pushing Power Platform to its full potential.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve led some pretty intense implementations. I learned a lot (and made some mistakes along the way as well), but I always aimed to keep learning, stay close to the tech, and build solutions that actually work for the people using them.

Thanks to my colleague Albert-Jan Schot who encouraged me to set this as a goal. Earlier this year I received the endorsement from customers for whom I worked for. That kicked off a detailed review process: meeting the prerequisites, gathering architecture docs and customer use cases and more. A couple of months ago I had my interview in which I got questions regarding to complexity of the projects and evaluation of the architecture, adherence of best practices and technical expertise. 

Eventually, I got the mail: I had been recognized as one of the [FTRSA for Power Apps](https://www.credly.com/badges/81c6dedd-cebd-41ca-9418-0ea16c7847ef) for 2025. ðŸŽ‰

Getting recognized was a proud moment. Iâ€™m still learning (every day), and Iâ€™m still as excited as ever about building great things with the Microsoft stack and improving business processes for different kind of organizations.
