Why persuasive power, real-time communication, and human ownership are more important than ever in the AI era.

## The power of the conversation

You know the drill: you're sitting with a client, or leading a workshop. The report is solid, the numbers check out. But it’s not until *you* explain it; in your own words, your own framing, your own nuance, that the message actually lands.

**Consulting isn’t Wikipedia with a tie. It’s a human craft.**

And yet… we’re increasingly supported by tools that generate reports, draw conclusions, and even draft emails in seconds.

That’s not a threat. It’s an invitation.  
An invitation to be even more aware of what *you* bring to the table.


## AI as a turbocharger

Let’s be clear: AI can be brilliant.  
I use it daily to boost my workflow. For example:

- 🧠 **Turning messy notes into readable text.**  
  You throw in a bunch of half-baked sentences, and ChatGPT spits out something polished.  
  But the thought, the logic**, the connections? Those still come from *you*.

- 🔗 **Linking information.**  
  If you're working with multiple sources, AI can help suggest patterns or themes.  
  But only *you* can spot the real connections that matter. That’s the essence of consulting.

- 📊 **Visualizing ideas.**  
  Flowcharts, Mermaid diagrams, visual summaries: AI can now whip them up from a voice note. _“If A, then B, unless C — draw it.”_ Boom. Done.

But here’s the thing: that’s still not persuasion. That only starts when **you** explain that diagram to the client. Clearly. In their language. With empathy and direction.



## The risk of distance

Sometimes you feel it right away:  
An AI-generated text that’s just… too smooth. Too corporate. Too polished.  
And as a result: emotionally flat. Empty.

You read it and think:  
_"Sure, it sounds okay… but this isn’t how I talk. This isn’t me."_

And that’s the point.  
**AI isn’t you.**

If there's a message with your name at the bottom, make sure it actually sounds like *you*. Not like a chatbot trained on how consultants *tend to write*, but like a person with a perspective.


## Human in the loop = Human at the wheel

The best setup isn’t man *or* machine. It’s man *and* machine.

You as the author, AI as your co-pilot.  
You create the message, AI suggests a tone.  
You spot the nuance, AI polishes the sentence.

That’s called **“human in the loop.”**  
I’d rather call it: **“human at the wheel.”**

Let AI assist. But never let it decide.  
Let it help you phrase something. But ask yourself: _“Would I actually say this to a client?”_

Because that’s your ultimate test.



## AI can write, you must persuade.  
🎓 _Time for a quick Aristotle throwback_

<img src="/images/20250716AIConsultancy/ethoslogospathos.png" width="300" height="200">


When we talk about persuasion, we have to mention a timeless classic: **Ethos, Pathos, Logos**.

- **Ethos** → Credibility: _Why should they trust you?_  
- **Pathos** → Emotion: _What do they care about? What’s at stake for them?_  
- **Logos** → Logic: _What facts or proof support your argument?_

AI is *great* at Logos. It can spit out facts, summaries, and structures all day long.  
But without **Ethos and Pathos**, it’s just a Wikipedia voice-over.

**That’s where you come in.**

You bring the _why you_ (ethos): your expertise, track record, real-life insight.  
You bring the _why this matters_ (pathos): the sense of urgency, empathy, impact.



## So, how do you use AI well?

Let AI help with:

- ✅ Structuring scattered thoughts  
- ✅ Sketching visuals like charts or diagrams  
- ✅ Generating metaphors or framing ideas  
- ✅ Cleaning up style and formatting

But *you* bring:

- 🗣️ The human tone  
- 🎯 The context  
- ❤️ The story that connects  

If it doesn’t sound like something you'd actually say in a live meeting, rewrite it.  
Because people don’t want a chatbot. They want *you*.



## The consultant of the future

The consultant of the future is not a data robot.  
It’s someone who partners with AI, but leads with presence.

Someone who uses tools to **prepare faster** and then **shows up better**.  
Someone who understands:

> **Persuasion isn’t automation. It’s connection.**

And no algorithm can replicate that.


## 🎯 Try this mini-exercise

> Take a recent email or slide you wrote with AI support.  
> Read it out loud.  
> Ask yourself:  
>
> _“Would I say this in an actual client conversation?”_  
>
> If not: rewrite it. Make it sound like you.  
> That’s how trust starts and how real influence happens.
