In this blog a budget allocation formula is introduced to deal with amounts of data of different time periods. Budgets could be daily, monthly or quarterly while registering it once. This creates a mismatch while creating a report.

The budget allocation calculation discussed in this blog allows you to solve this mismatch and it also enables you to easily switch between different time contexts.

## End result
The final outcome comprises a form where users can input details and perform calculations for various time units.

## User input
The form contains of the following input fields:
* Total amount (Textinput) 
* Period (Combobox) Items to choose from: ["Daily", "Monthly", "Quarterly"]
* Start date (Datepicker)
* End date (Datepicker)

## Calculation
In PowerFx, utilizing a variable within a ForAll loop is not possible; therefor the button control couldn't handle the entire calculcation, however, the timer control can be helpful in such cases.

### Timer control configuration
The Calculate element on the form looks like a button, but it's actually the timer control.
This control needs some configuration.

Set Duration to 50.

#### OnSelect
![OnSelect](/images/20240228AllocateBudgetPeriodicallyPowerFx/OnSelect.png)


```
//Determine TimeUnit based on combobox selection
If(cmbPeriod.Selected.Value = "Daily",
    UpdateContext({varTimeUnit: TimeUnit.Days}),
    If(cmbPeriod.Selected.Value = "Monthly",
        UpdateContext({varTimeUnit: TimeUnit.Months}),
        UpdateContext({varTimeUnit: TimeUnit.Quarters})
    )
);

//Calculate number of periods and amount that needs to be allocated to each period
UpdateContext({PeriodNumber: Sum(DateDiff(dtpStart.SelectedDate,dtpEnd.SelectedDate,varTimeUnit), 1)});
UpdateContext({PeriodAmount: Text(Value(txtAmount.Text) / PeriodNumber,"â‚¬#.##")});

//Set local variable
UpdateContext({PeriodsCalculated: 1});
UpdateContext({varStartDate: dtpStart.SelectedDate});

Clear(colAllocatedBudget);
```

The 'PeriodNumber' is determined using a DateDiff combined with Sum formula. Omitting this calculation will lead to an incomplete result in this scenario. For instance, if the start date is 04-04-2024 and the end date is 04-06-2024, only two rows of budget allocation will be generated, omitting 04-06-2024.

#### OnTimerEnd

![OnTimerEnd](/images/20240228AllocateBudgetPeriodicallyPowerFx/OnTimerEnd.png)

```
Collect(
    colAllocatedBudget,
    {
        Amount: PeriodAmount,
        Period: If(varTimeUnit = TimeUnit.Days,Text(varStartDate,"dd-mm-yyyy"),
            If(varTimeUnit = TimeUnit.Months,Text(varStartDate,"mm-yyyy"),
               Concatenate("Q", Text(RoundUp(Month(varStartDate) / 3, 0)), "-", Text(varStartDate, "yyyy"))
        ))
    }
);
UpdateContext({PeriodsCalculated: PeriodsCalculated + 1});
UpdateContext({varStartDate: DateAdd(varStartDate,1,varTimeUnit)});
```

The OnTimerEnd fills the collection with the amount that needs to be allocated and the period in which the amount needs to be allocated. 
 

#### Repeat
![Repeat](/images/20240228AllocateBudgetPeriodicallyPowerFx/Repeat.png)

`PeriodNumber > PeriodsCalculated`

The repeat parameter specifies the number of repetitions. Therefore, the total number of calculations will be compared to the number actually performed.


The final step involves configuring a gallery to showcase the contents of the collection, which will automatically refresh upon completion of a calculation.
