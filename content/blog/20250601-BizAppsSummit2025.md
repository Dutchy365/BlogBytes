Two years ago where it all started at the European Collaboration Summit 2023 I started [my first blog](/blog/20230525-collaborationsummit2023/).

Next to I added something to my bucket list: presenting on the event myself, just as a personal challenge. 

Fast forward to now: this blog is the result of both goals in action. Last week, I got to speak at **European BizApps Summit 2025** together with Albert-Jan Schot.

## Keynote and sessions

**Marco Casalaina** kicked things off during keynote with cool demos. Realtime translation of spoken voice — and it automatically detected the language. It *just knew*. Pretty impressive. 

In one of the sessions **Mark Rackley** took the stage and explained specific content on Copilot and made sure that Copilot isn't trained on your data, it's an *orchestration*. Smart orchestration, yes, but still orchestration. 

During a session from **Bill Ayers** he turned complex ideas into sticky metaphors. Fruit fly vs Azure vs human being and the amount of neural network difference between them. The point? The pace at which large language models are evolving is staggering. And while trying to predict the future sometimes feels like ancient fortune telling, one thing is clear: things are moving fast. And getting faster.

One quote really stuck with me:

> **“Today is the slowest day of technology change for the rest of your life.” – Jim Carroll**

Let that sink in. The pace of innovation isn’t just rapid — it’s accelerating. .

## And one last thing...

Two years ago, I tweeted a buzzword bingo card — mostly as a joke. You know the usual suspects: “AI”, “Copilot”...

Fast forward to today, and I was *on stage* talking about AI. Even funnier: after preparing our talk, I realized we had unintentionally created our *own* AI Buzzword Bingo card. It came full circle.

Huge thanks to everyone who attended our session and smiled when our demo didn’t crash. Until next time — and don’t forget your bingo cards. You never know what the next buzzword will be.
