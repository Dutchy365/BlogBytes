In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, organizations often find themselves relying on outdated Excel-based processes, which pose significant risks. However, with the emergence of the Power Platform, a revolutionary low-code development platform, there is a transformative solution at hand. This blog explores the potential of the Power Platform in streamlining operations, mitigating risks, and empowering employees to become citizen developers.

## Excel as business critical 
When people ask what exactly you can do with Power Platform, we often make comparisons with what people used to make in Excel. Well, used to be, I wish I could say. We still come across it, business-critical processes that rely entirely on an Excel with all sorts of formulas. Employees creating complex formulas and macros. Still, a big risk for an organization. Management is not regulated, what if someone accidentally adjusts a formula, who notices? A risk that is not always recognised because 'it has been like this for years and it has never gone wrong'. So the moment it goes wrong, it goes badly wrong. The need for change is evident, and the Power Platform offers a promising way forward.

## A solid foundation
We sometimes jokingly say:

 > "What is the most frequently used functionality of an ERP system" 
>
> "...the export to Excel". 

Apparently, the standard application lacks capabilities and is insufficiently adequate for what employees really need in their day-to-day work. To address this need, the concept of citizen developers is introduced—employees with minimal programming experience who can leverage the Power Platform's low-code capabilities to create simple applications. By bridging the gap between Excel expertise and application development, organizations can tap into the untapped potential of their workforce and unlock a wealth of innovation.

Rather than relying solely on an ERP system, organizations can combine the strengths of their existing infrastructure with the Power Platform's agility and flexibility. This integration ensures that users have the tools they need in their day-to-day work.

Defining governance principles and implementing a Center of Excellence enables organizations to steer and support citizen developers effectively. Furthermore, the creation of a Landing Zone, equipped with technical and functional guidelines, provides a safe and structured environment for users to explore the Power Platform's capabilities.

## Conclusion
With the Power Platform, organizations have the opportunity to revolutionize their operations by empowering employees and leveraging their Excel expertise. By establishing a solid foundation and embracing citizen developers, organizations can achieve newfound efficiency and unlock a world of innovation. 

The Power Platform is not just a tool—it's a transformative force that propels organizations towards a brighter and more productive future.
