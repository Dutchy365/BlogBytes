Power Platform adoption doesn’t start with a full-fledged governance strategy—it starts when people begin experimenting. Even before you’ve set up a Landing Zone or Center of Excellence, there’s often already momentum. That’s a great thing.

But inspiration alone isn’t enough. What many organizations miss is giving employees a path from idea to implementation. That means making it easy to propose, shape, and justify a solution. And that’s where a simple **business case one-pager** comes in.

By providing a lightweight format for submitting ideas, you keep the door open for innovation—without overwhelming governance from day one. 

As written in [part 1 of this blog](/blog/20250512-AdoptionBusinessValue/), it's good to give employees the opportunity to share ideas by filling out a predefined one-pager.

Using a one-pager forces employees to think about their idea in a structured way. Let them create mutual enthusiasm, but also awareness that new developments have consequences.


## When to write a Business Case

Business cases should be written for proposals that go beyond routine functional or technical maintenance, such as:

- Proposals for improving information systems
- Major maintenance of existing solutions
- Replacing outdated systems
- Bundling smaller improvements into a larger initiative

The business case justifies the project by balancing estimated costs, expected benefits, and associated risks.



## Topics of the one-pager

Have employees think about the background of the idea—what problem they're solving and what ambition drives them.  
Encourage them to consider not only **costs**, but also **benefits**—both financial and non-financial, like Knowledge sharing, Increasing employee satisfaction, boosting engagement, enhancing brand image and internal reputation.
