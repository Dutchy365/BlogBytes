## Power Platform adoption starts with building the business case
There are plenty of opportunities to add value with the Power Platform. And interestingly, user adoption often begins even before anything is officially in place.

As an introduction to the Power Platform, organizations can offer anything from ‚ÄúApp in a Day‚Äù workshops and lunch-and-learn sessions to learning pages on the intranet‚Äîanything that inspires employees. Fantastic! But what‚Äôs often overlooked is that concepts and ideas gets lost. So, give employees a clear path from experimentation to real results.

There are always more ideas floating around than can realistically be developed. To keep those ideas from ending up in the bin, you need to offer a roadmap‚Äîone that‚Äôs free of barriers and frustration.

## The Context
We can throw around big words like governance and compliance, but in this case, the responsibility for setting policies and frameworks doesn‚Äôt rest with all the employees in the business. That‚Äôs where tools like the Landing Zone and Center of Excellence come in. They support the process so not all employees need to get involved with the technical or governance side. They just need space to work on their ideas.

## That physical suggestion box wasn't so bad after all

Every employee, in every department, should have the chance to submit an idea. Use a standardized form. 
Ask employees to complete a predefined one-pager. How to approach that, and what should go in the one-pager? You‚Äôll find that in [part 2 of this blog](/blog/20250501-businesscasebusinessvalue).

And of course‚Äîas a Power Platform consultant, I can‚Äôt resist pointing to the possibility to create this form in a Power App. Rolling this out promotes Power Platform use and reinforces that internal ‚Äúpractice what you preach‚Äù mindset. It‚Äôs a win for adoption.

## And then? The process after submission: managing expectations

Be clear about what happens next. How long will it take to get a response? The one-pager with the business case should be reviewed‚Äîand feedback sent to the submitter. That feedback matters. They‚Äôve put in the effort and shown commitment, so treat it seriously.

If every idea just gets rejected, people will stop submitting. But when you actively do something with those ideas, you‚Äôll see momentum build. A transparent, respectful process increases employee engagement‚Äîand the Power Platform ends up driving its own success.
