My name is Elianne and I am a Power Platform Consultant at [Blis Digital](https://blisdigital.com) in Barendrecht, The Netherlands. Since 2016 I obtained several Microsoft certifications, among others: MCT, MCSE for SharePoint, MCSA for Office 365 and Power Platform Solution Architect Expert.

I love to gain more knowledge and expertise by going to different user groups and conferences myself, but I also like to share knowledge in different ways: by writing blogs, giving presentations, guest lectures at an university of applied science and app-in-a-day workshops.

I have a Master of Science where I graduated cum laude in the field of Business Process Management and IT. In my off-time I like spending time with family and friends, doing some board games or different kind of sport activities. 

This blog has mainly two purposes: my own documentation so I won't forget how some particular problems were solved and off course to give something back to the community.
