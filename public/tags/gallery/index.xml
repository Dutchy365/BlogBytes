      <description>Scenario One of the features often used in Power Apps is the gallery, which typically requires filtering and search functionality. Initially, you might set up a gallery with just two filters and a search box. However, as you continue developing, end-users often request additional filtering options. Time and time again, I found it challenging to easily implement these extra filters. That&amp;rsquo;s when I realized it was time to document my approach; hopefully, you can benefit from it too.</description>

      <description>Having a good user experience is key, especially in app design. A nicely done progress bar in Power Apps can really boost this experience by giving users a clear and easy way to see their progress through various tasks. Whether they&amp;rsquo;re filling out forms, working through workflows, or going through multi-step procedures, a simple progress bar helps users know exactly where they are in the process.&#xA;Whatâ€™s great about this progress bar is how it adjusts to fit the input table.</description>
