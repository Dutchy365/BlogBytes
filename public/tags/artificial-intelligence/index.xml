      <description>A couple of months ago I wrote my first blog&#xD;as a reflection on AI. This second piece continues that exploration, this time focusing on the part that fascinates (and unsettles) me most: the feeling that chatbots are becoming human.&#xA;AI at work vs. daily life In my work, I encounter AI on a daily basisâ€”not just in the tools and technologies we use, but also in the enthusiasm of people who work with it.</description>

      <description>Until now, I have avoided writing about the topic of &amp;lsquo;AI&amp;rsquo;. This was a conscious choice, since I feel that everyone is already writing about this and you almost get &amp;lsquo;AI tired&amp;rsquo; by now. Nevertheless, in a short period of time I came across a number of things that inspired me to write down my thoughts on the subject. Think of it as a diary text, nice to read back years later (or in this AI era, after a few months) and then look: &amp;lsquo;wow, that was still old-fashioned, they should have known back then&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;.</description>
