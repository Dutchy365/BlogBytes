      <description>Power Platform adoption doesn‚Äôt start with a full-fledged governance strategy‚Äîit starts when people begin experimenting. Even before you‚Äôve set up a Landing Zone or Center of Excellence, there‚Äôs often already momentum. That‚Äôs a great thing.&#xA;But inspiration alone isn‚Äôt enough. What many organizations miss is giving employees a path from idea to implementation. That means making it easy to propose, shape, and justify a solution. And that‚Äôs where a simple business case one-pager comes in.</description>

Fantastic! But what‚Äôs often overlooked is that concepts and ideas gets lost.</description>
