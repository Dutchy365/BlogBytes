      <description>&lt;p&gt;Power Platform adoption doesn’t start with a full-fledged governance strategy—it starts when people begin experimenting. Even before you’ve set up a Landing Zone or Center of Excellence, there’s often already momentum. That’s a great thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But inspiration alone isn’t enough. What many organizations miss is giving employees a path from idea to implementation. That means making it easy to propose, shape, and justify a solution. And that’s where a simple &lt;strong&gt;business case one-pager&lt;/strong&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;power-platform-adoption-starts-with-building-the-business-case&#34;&gt;Power Platform adoption starts with building the business case&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of opportunities to add value with the Power Platform. And interestingly, user adoption often begins even before anything is officially in place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an introduction to the Power Platform, organizations can offer anything from “App in a Day” workshops and lunch-and-learn sessions to learning pages on the intranet—anything that inspires employees. Fantastic! But what’s often overlooked is that concepts and ideas gets lost. So, give employees a clear path from experimentation to real results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
