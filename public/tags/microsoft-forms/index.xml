      <description>Creating a social intranet that fosters collaboration and engagement among employees is essential in today&amp;rsquo;s digital workplace. One effective component of a social intranet is a &amp;ldquo;question of the week&amp;rdquo; or poll functionality. While SharePoint doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a built-in poll feature, you can use a Microsoft Form with one question to achieve the same effect. However, updating the question weekly can be a manual and time-consuming task.&#xA;Unfortunately, Microsoft doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a standard API for Microsoft Forms that can easily be integrated with Power Automate to automate question creation and management of a Form.</description>
