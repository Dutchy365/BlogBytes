      <description>In SharePoint lists, we&amp;rsquo;re familiar to creating both shared views for all users and personal views tailored to individual preferences. As you develop Power Apps, you might frequently ask, &amp;ldquo;Can I create a custom view just for me?&amp;rdquo; Users often need different information displayed in their views. This blog explains how you can accomplish this in Power Apps!&#xA;End result The end result is a gallery including a header for which users can create their own view or use the default view.</description>

      <description>Side note: As of writing this blog, Dataverse low-code plugins are still in preview.&#xA;In the Dataverse Accelerator app, you have the opportunity to create plugins. This blog focuses on the possibilities of automated plugins.&#xA;After selecting a table, you can choose different types of triggers: when a row is created, updated, or deleted. To get information about existing records, you can&amp;rsquo;t use ThisItem or ThisRecord, and Set behaves differently compared to Power Apps Canvas.</description>

      <description>Side note: while writing this blog Dataverse low-code plugins are still in preview.&#xA;Scenario This blog explores a real-world business scenario involving multiple meeting rooms where CO‚ÇÇ levels are monitored throughout the day. These measurements indicate the presence of people in the rooms. By correlating this data with the meeting room reservations, we can infer the room occupancy.&#xA;End result The end result is a Power App in which a calender view is available in which you can see whether a meetingroom was occupied during the meeting or not.</description>

      <description>Scenario This blogs scenario is regarding a plain multi line text input in which no rich text was allowed. Requirement was just one exception to have the ability to have clickable hyperlinks.&#xA;In the Dataverse table no html is stored only plain text, so using a markdown syntax notation was the solution.&#xA;Markdown syntax for a hyperlink is square brackets followed by parentheses. The square brackets hold the text, the parentheses hold the link.</description>

      <description>Dynamics Forms Inspired by Matthey Devaney&#xD;, a fully dynamic form was created in Power Apps, incorporating various question types like toggles, text inputs, and comboboxes. Everything worked smoothly until the need for tabular questions came along.&#xA;For these tabular questions, the requirement was to allow flexible setup of the question and definition of table headers, enabling end users to enter their answers in the rows below. This challenge is now ready to be addressed üí™üèª.</description>

      <link>http://localhost:1313/BlogBytes/blog/20230926-powerappsvalidatingnamingconventions/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/BlogBytes/blog/20230926-powerappsvalidatingnamingconventions/</guid>
      <description>Why naming conventions One of the main advices while creating Power Apps canvas apps is to use proper naming conventions for all the components you&amp;rsquo;re using. Not only to support readability for your own usage, also for supportability. Probably it&amp;rsquo;s not too difficult to convince someone of its importance, while in the hustle and bustle of everyday life, you don&amp;rsquo;t give it priority always.&#xA;Some advantages:&#xA;Consistency; so you can better focus on the solution Maintainability; everyone has the same language and can therefore navigate through a solution more easily Interchangeability; copying, changing and maintaining solutions can be done by multiple people ‚Äã This blog gives and explains a Powershell script which you can use to validate naming convention in your Power App.</description>
