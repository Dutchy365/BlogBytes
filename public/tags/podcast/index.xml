      <description>Until now, I have avoided writing about the topic of &amp;lsquo;AI&amp;rsquo;. This was a conscious choice, since I feel that everyone is already writing about this and you almost get &amp;lsquo;AI tired&amp;rsquo; by now. Nevertheless, in a short period of time I came across a number of things that inspired me to write down my thoughts on the subject. Think of it as a diary text, nice to read back years later (or in this AI era, after a few months) and then look: &amp;lsquo;wow, that was still old-fashioned, they should have known back then&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;.</description>
