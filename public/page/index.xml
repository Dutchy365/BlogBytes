      <description>My name is Elianne and I am a Power Platform Consultant at Blis Digitalin Barendrecht, The Netherlands. Since 2016 I held several Microsoft certifications that currently include: MCT, MCSE for SharePoint, MCSA for Office 365 and Power Platform Solution Architect Expert.
I love to gain more knowledge and expertise by going to different user groups and conferences myself, but I also like to share knowledge in different ways: by writing blogs, giving presentations, guest lectures at local university of applied science and app-in-a-day workshops.</description>
